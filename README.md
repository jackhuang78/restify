Access SQL database using the REST styles.

##Purpose
When using SQL database for web application, the backend often creates specific REST APIs for accessing the database. Most of the time, however, these APIs are really just the mundane work of translating REST queries into SQL queries. 

The goal of this library is to take that work away by providing an generic REST interface for the SQL database.
